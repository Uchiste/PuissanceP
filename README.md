# PuissanceP

PuissanceP is board game created by a friend and myself.

The rules are differents from the game Four-in-a-Row. The board is arranged with empty spaces.
-You and your opponent play turn by turn.
-Once your piece is placed, you can't move it.
-There is no limit of point.
-To mark a points you have to align four pieces in a row, column, diagonal (1 points)
    (you can use pieces that have already been used for an other point but with a maximum of 2 pieces already used out of four pieces)
-You can play everywhere you want if there is a link to a side of the board
